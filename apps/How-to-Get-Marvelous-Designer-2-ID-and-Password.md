### Step 1: Import your character model
 
The first step is to import your character model into Marvelous Designer 2. You can do this by clicking on the "File" menu and selecting "Import". You can import your character model in various formats, such as OBJ, FBX, DAE, or LWO. You can also adjust the scale and orientation of your character model in the import settings.
 
### Step 2: Create a pattern
 
The next step is to create a pattern for your garment. You can do this by using the "Pattern" tool on the left toolbar. You can draw a pattern by clicking and dragging on the 2D window. You can also use the "Edit Pattern" tool to modify the shape and size of your pattern. You can also use the "Symmetric Pattern" tool to create a mirrored copy of your pattern.
 
### Step 3: Sew the pattern
 
The third step is to sew the pattern pieces together to form a garment. You can do this by using the "Sew" tool on the left toolbar. You can sew two pattern pieces by clicking on their edges in the 2D window. You can also use the "Edit Sewing" tool to adjust the direction and length of the sewing lines. You can also use the "Free Sewing" tool to sew two pattern pieces without clicking on their edges.
 
### Step 4: Simulate the garment
 
The fourth step is to simulate the garment on your character model. You can do this by clicking on the "Simulation" button on the top toolbar. This will make the garment drape and fit on your character model according to the physics and properties of the fabric. You can also use the "Simulation Settings" window to adjust the parameters of the simulation, such as gravity, wind, collision, and friction.
 
### Step 5: Add details and textures
 
The final step is to add details and textures to your garment. You can do this by using the "Detail" tool on the left toolbar.
